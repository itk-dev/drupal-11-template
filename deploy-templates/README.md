## Site installation

Run the following commands to set up the site a new. This will start containers
and run composer install, add a settings.php file and run site-install.

```shell name="site-new"
task compose -- up --detach
task composer -- install
task build-site:new
```

If the site has existing config and a settings.php file build the site from that.

```shell name="site-install"
task compose -- up --detach
task composer -- install
task build-site:existing-conf
```

When the installation is completed, that admin user is created and the password for logging in the outputted. If you
forget the password, use `drush user:login` command to get a one-time-login URL (note: the URI here only works if
you are using Traefik and [ITK-dev docker setup](https://github.com/itk-dev/devops_itkdev-docker)).

```shell name="site-login"
itkdev-docker-compose drush user:login
```
